PET Scan (DPSH 5/04/74): 1) Marked hypometabolism involving the bilateral caudate nuclei. This is a non-specific finding, although this raises the question of a multisystem atrophy, specifically MSA-P (striatonigral degeneration), 2) Cortical hypometabolism involving the right inferior frontal gyrus. This is a non-specific finding of uncertain significance, and is not definitively related to a neurodegenerative process, although pathology in this region is not excluded

50 yo DWF with a history of alcohol use disorder, anxiety and depression, and prior trauma history, no prior psychiatric treatment referred for care at ZMH by PCP.  She is seeking help mainly around management of anxiety, and it is unclear to what extent alcohol (which she has not consumed since May 2016) is affecting her current situation.  Biological factors include likely primary mood and/or anxiety disorders (perhaps depression with panic attacks), consequences of long-term alcohol use. Important psychological factors include the loss of three improtant family members and the prior trauma at multiple times. Her social situation reflects isolation and an unfortunately high level of dependence on her children.  One important challenge is her discomfort with opening up and seeking care, which may benefit from positive treatment alliances.

She shared that she has recently lost a great deal of weight and is having difficulty meeting her calorie needs due to difficulties with gagging/swallowing, and aversions to specific food textures.
